Smart pet feeder (ESP8266)
    
üß≠ Objetivo

Design a fully functional PCB from scratch to control an automatic pet feeder using an ESP8266, infrared sensors, a stepper motor, and a buzzer. This project serves as a personal bridge between industrial automation and embedded electronics design.


‚öôÔ∏è Specifications

The system is based on an ESP8266 with integrated WiFi connectivity, an infrared sensor to detect the animal, and a stepper motor that drives a worm screw to dispense food, along with a buzzer for audio alerts. The two-layer PCB, designed in EasyEDA, takes a 12‚ÄØV input, which is regulated down to 5‚ÄØV for peripherals and 3.3‚ÄØV for the microcontroller.

To facilitate programming, two physical push buttons were added: one for BOOT (GPIO0) and another for RESET, along with a switch to select operating modes or activate specific system functions.


üß© Technical Design

El The schematic was based on an existing design but was resized and adapted according to component availability. I used EasyEDA as the main tool since it integrates directly with LCSC's component stock, helping reduce costs and ensuring availability during manufacturing.

For the physical layout, I applied techniques such as copper pour and polygon fills to improve heat dissipation and reduce EMI. The bottom layer of the PCB is a full GND plane, which provides clean signal return paths. Additionally, the ESP8266 antenna zone was partially cut out to improve wireless performance.

II also paid close attention to the top-layer silkscreen, clearly labeling each component. However, one improvement for the next revision is to properly mark the GND and 3.3‚ÄØV pins on the TTL programming connector.


üõ†Ô∏è Issues Encountered (and Resolved)

Misconfigured GPIO15: This strapping pin was mistakenly connected to 3.3‚ÄØV instead of GND.
‚Üí Resolved by desoldering and rerouting via resistor R7.

Missing silkscreen for programming pins: The GND and 3.3‚ÄØV pins were not labeled on the TTL header, making setup harder during testing.
‚Üí To be fixed in the next PCB iteration.

Buzzer and LED miswiring: The buzzer and the activity LED were not connected properly, preventing the LED from indicating the microcontroller's status.
‚Üí Identified during testing; logic will be corrected in the next version.


üîß Assembly, Programming & Next Steps

Manual PCB assembly and ESP8266 programming using a USB‚ÄìTTL converter.
Next step: develop a mobile app to connect to the system via WiFi.
Implement logic to detect the animal and trigger feeding from the mobile app.
Redesign the circuit to use a single 5‚ÄØV power input for simplicity.
Add test points to assist with debugging.
Evaluate upgrading to an ESP32 for extended functionality.
Refactor the system into modular blocks for better scalability and reusability.
